# VariationalQMLTimeSeriesBenchmark

## Installation

To install the required packages, run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Job Submission (SLURM)

To submit jobs to a SLURM cluster, execute the `starting_run.sh` script. You will need to modify the script to load the appropriate modules and specify the path to your virtual environment.

## Configuration

Jobs to submit are specified in the `configurations_totrain.json` file.

## Testing Single Trainings

Single trainings can be tested by modifying the parameters in the `training_and_analyzing.py` script.

## Result Extraction

The `extract_results.ipynb` notebook sorts trained models into DataFrames and generates `.csv` files for analysis.

## Data Generation and Plotting

The notebooks in the `TimeseriesData` directory must be run to generate the datasets and corresponding plots.

## Lyapunov Time Analysis

The `nolds_lyapunov_r.ipynb` notebook is used to analyze the Lyapunov time of the datasets.

## Plot Recreation

Notebooks in the `Create_Plots` directory can be used to recreate the plots from the paper.

## Ansatz Optimization for ru-QNN

For the optimization of the ansatz for the ru-QNN model, different ansätze are generated by the `generate_ru_strings.ipynb` notebook.

The best ansätze are determined using the `optimize_ru_vqc_ansatz.ipynb` notebook.
